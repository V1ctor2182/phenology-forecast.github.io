## TO DO list

We are also curious about how well we can model the continuous time series.

Try this [**method**](https://rdrr.io/rforge/greenbrown/man/FitDoubleLogElmore.html) using a double logistic model.
1. Run their example
2. Try with our MODIS data

After fitting a simple double logistic model, we can fit a model for several years of data. I like [**this method**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425721002029?)

3. Run their [**example**](https://github.com/ncsuSEAL/Bayesian_LSP)
4. Try with our MODIS data
